This part is required for full credit.</p><p>HW steps:</p><ol><li>Open VS Code at the root of your repository folder (you should see the Procfile and all from the Heroku setup)</li><li>In VS Code create a new folder/directory in public_html called M2</li><li>Create 3 new files in this new M2 folder (problem1.php, problem2.php, problem3.php)</li><li>Paste each template into their respective files</li><li><code>git add .</code></li><li><code>git commit -m "adding template baselines</code></li><li>Do the related work (you may do steps 8 and 9 as often as needed or you can do it all at once at the end)</li><li><code>git add .</code></li><li><code>git commit -m "completed hw"</code></li><li>When you're done push the branch<ol><li><code>git push origin M2-PHP-HW</code></li></ol></li><li>Go to heroku dev, and manually deploy the M2-PHP-HW branch</li><li>After it deploys go to&nbsp;<a href="https://ucid-dev.herokuapp.com/M2/problem1.php">https://ucid-dev.herokuapp.com/M2/problem1.php</a>&nbsp;(replace ucid with your ucid if you followed the setup instructions)</li><li>Update the URL to check that each problem file displays properly</li><li>Create the Pull Request with&nbsp;<strong>dev</strong>&nbsp;as base and&nbsp;<strong>M2-PHP-HW</strong>&nbsp;as compare</li><li>Create a new file in the M2 folder in VS Code called m2_submission.md</li><li>Fill out the below deliverable items, save the submission, and copy to markdown<ol><li>For this assignment you may get screenshots from your heroku dev instance, you do not need to move it to prod then come back and update it</li></ol></li><li>Paste the markdown into the m2_submission.md</li><li>add/commit/push the md file<ol><li><code>git add m2_submission.md</code></li><li><code>git commit -m "adding submission file"</code></li><li><code>git push origin M2-PHP-HW</code></li></ol></li><li>Merge the pull request from step 14</li><li>Create a new pull request with prod as base and dev as compare</li><li>Immediately create/merge/confirm, this is just to deploy it to prod and you don't need to adjust anything during this step</li><li>On your local machine sync the changes<ol><li><code>git checkout dev</code></li><li><code>git pull origin dev</code></li></ol></li><li>Submit the link to the m2_submission.md file from the prod branch to Canvas</li></ol><p><br></p></td></tr></table>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I used a &#39;foreach&#39; loop which is part of PHP to iterate over<br>each element in the list, and called it value. I used the modulo<br>function to check if the element is odd; if it was, it was<br>echoed, followed by a break tag for indentation.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I used a foreach loop to loop over the array and add the<br>value of each element to total. Rounding was done using the sprintf() function<br>which prints values according to the specified string format (.2f). I tried using<br>the round() function, but this was not giving me the leading zero on<br>&#39;0.1&#39; that was required.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I used a foreach loop and assigned each value a key so that<br>it could be accessed.

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I learned a lot about the PHP language which I had not known<br>before, namely the &#39;foreach&#39; loop feature; being able to designate key value pairs<br>was very convenient. One issue I ran into was in uploading to the<br>AFS hosted website; I followed instructions as specified, downloading VPN, using FileZilla to<br>copy solution files over, SSHing into afsconnect to make sure that my website<br>was configured for display, but still could not get it to work. I<br>have opened a ticket with a help desk because everything should be working;<br>I will make sure this is resolved for future assignments, but as of<br>the time of this submission, it is still unresolved.<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
