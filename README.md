# IT 202 SECTION 451

This is a repository created by myself–Shahbaj Singh– for maintaining coursework related to IT 202: Internet Applications. Tools being used thus far include:

* PHP
* MySQL

I have included a file [check_collaborators.yml](.github/workflows/check_collaborators.yml) to run an automated GitHub action that checks for repository privacy and collaborator presence.
